# Bicubic Search Engine

## Description
Bicubic Search Engine can enlarge the selected 2-dimension data to an arbitrary required size.  
The original image data is stored in ROM, and the image data after scaling will be written into SRAM by the bicubic search engine.  
PS: It is a competition question for the preliminary round of IC Contest 2024 (Cell-based).

## Introduction to cubic interpolation
Let $p(x)$ be the pixel after scaling.  
Let $p(0)$ and p(1) are the left and right pixels adjacent to $p(x)$ respectively.  
Let $p(-1)$ be the pixels on the left side of $p(0)$ and $p(2)$ be the pixels on the right side of $p(1)$.

Let $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, where $0 \leq x \leq 1$.  
Known $p(0)$ and $p(1)$ that $p(0) = d$ and $p(1) = a + b + c + d$.  

In this question, we assume the slope of p(0) and p(1) are $\frac{p(1)-p(-1)}{2}$ and $\frac{p(2)-p(0)}{2}$ respectively.  
Known the slope equation $p'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.  
Then, we can get  
$p'(0) = c = \frac{p(1)-p(-1)}{2}$  
$p'(1) = a + b + c = \frac{p(2)-p(0)}{2}$  

According to the above equations, we can get  
$a = -\frac{1}{2}p(-1) + \frac{3}{2}p(0) - \frac{3}{2}p(1) + \frac{1}{2}p(2)$  
$b = p(-1) - \frac{5}{2}p(0) + 2p(1) - \frac{1}{2}p(2)$  
$c = -\frac{1}{2}p(-1) + \frac{1}{2}p(1)$  
$d = p(0)$  

Finally, substituting $a, b, c$ and $d$ into the original equation to get p(x).  

## Introduction to bicubic interpolation
One-dimensional cubic interpolation uses the values of 4 points to obtain an interpolated value.
As shown in the figure below, two-dimensional bicubic interpolation uses the values of 16 points to compute the interpolated value in an image.
The method involves first calculating the one-dimensional cubic interpolation results for each of the 4 horizontal red lines, 
and then using these 4 results to compute the one-dimensional cubic interpolation along the vertical green line.
It can be seen from this that a two-dimensional cubic interpolation is completed by performing five consecutive one-dimensional cubic interpolation operations.
